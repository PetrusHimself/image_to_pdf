This is a simple Python program that utilizes the `img2pdf` library to convert images to PDF files and the `PyPDF2` library to convert PDF files to images. Make sure to install these libraries using pip before running the program.

To use the program, replace `"input_image.jpg"` with the path to your input image file. Similarly, set the desired output paths for the converted PDF file (`pdf_path`) and the directory where the converted images will be saved (`output_directory`).

Remember to install the necessary libraries by running `pip install img2pdf PyPDF2 pillow` in your command prompt or terminal before executing the program.
